            <h2 id="licensee-provisions">Licensee Provisions</h2>
            <p><small>Note: <strong>Licensee</strong> is PDFShift whereas, <strong>Licensor</strong> is the user using PDFShift.</small></p>
            <p>— Licensor will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless licensee for third party intellectual property infringement.</p>
            <p>
                — If Licensee’s continued use of the Software is restricted or prohibited as a result of any such infringement,
                Licensor shall, at Licensee’s option and at no charge to Licensee:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>i. secure for Licensee the right to continue using the Software</li>
                    <li>ii. modify or replace the infringing components of the Software so that they are non-infringing</li>
                    <li>iii. refund to Licensee all amounts paid by Licensee for the Software</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>— Exclusions—</strong><br />
                Licensor will not be obligated to indemnify Licensee to the extent of the infringement claim based upon
                (i) use of the Software in breach of this Agreement (ii) any modification of the Software made by Licensee
                (other than at Licensor’s direction)
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>— Defense of Third-Party Suits—</strong><br />
                Licensee will notify Licensor of third party suits promptly. If licensee tenders claim to Licensor,
                Licensor will have right and obligation to defend such claim. Once Licensor assumes defense of a Claim,
                it will be conclusively presumed that Licensor is obligated to indemnify Licensee. No settlement of a Claim will be binding on Licensee
                without Licensee’s prior written consent.
