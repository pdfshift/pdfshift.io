            c) Process and shall ensure each person acting under its authority shall Process <strong>Company</strong>
            Personal Data only on the relevant <strong>Company</strong>'s documented instructions unless Processing is

            extent permitted by applicable laws inform <strong>Company</strong> of that legal requirement before the
            relevant Processing of that Personal Data, and<br>
            d) immediately inform <strong>Company</strong> in writing if, in the Vendor’s opinion, a Processing
            instruction infringes the applicable data protection laws or any other applicable laws relating to data

            fulfilment of the Company’s obligations, as reasonably understood by <strong>Company</strong>, to respond to
            requests to exercise Data Subject rights under the applicable data protection laws. In addition, to the

        <p>3.2 <strong>Reliability.</strong><br>
            Vendor shall take commercially reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of any Vendor personnel and Vendor
            Subprocessor personnel who may have access to the <strong>Company</strong> Personal Data.</p>

            in each case as soon as practicable meeting the obligations set out in this Clause 4. Current list of
            subprocessors is available on <a href="http://www.pdfshift.io/gdpr">www.pdfshift.io/gdpr</a></p>
        <p>4.3 <strong>New Subprocessors.</strong><br>
            Vendor shall give <strong>Company</strong> prior written notice of the appointment of any new or replacement
            Subprocessor, including full details of the Processing to be undertaken by the Subprocessor. If, within 10

            reasonable grounds) to the proposed appointment:<br>
            Vendor shall work with <strong>Company</strong> in good faith to make available a commercially reasonable
            change in the provision of the Services which avoids the use of that proposed Subprocessor; and where such a
            change cannot be made within 30 days from Vendor’s receipt of Company’s notice, notwithstanding anything in
            the Principal Agreement, <strong>Company</strong> may by written notice to Vendor with immediate effect
            terminate the Principal Agreement to the extent that it relates to the Services which require the use of the
            proposed Subprocessor.</p>

            Data implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate
            to that risk, including, as appropriate, the measures referred to in the applicable data protection laws,
            especially Article 32 of the GDPR. In assessing the appropriate level of security, Vendor shall take account
